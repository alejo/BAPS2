--------------

Sense if reset is held down when we boot.  If reset is down we execute
a (user defined) script called /etc/on_reset_down.  Note that only
/etc/on_reset_down will be executed - no other services will be
booted.  This prevents other services over-riding on_reset_down, e.g.
setting up the network twice.  It also allows recovery from damaged
service start-up scripts.

Here is a sample /etc/on_reset_down script to try:

#!/bin/sh
echo "on reset down!"
ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.30
