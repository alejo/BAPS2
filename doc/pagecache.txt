pagecache.txt
-------------

Trivial package to set the pagecache_ratio at start up.  This sets
the % of available memory that can be used for buffering files.  By
default this is 100%, which is bad news as the system gradually uses
all it's memory for buffering files, leaving none for applications.

1/ To check the current ratio:

  $ cat /proc/sys/vm/pagecache_ratio

2/ To manually set ratio to 30%:

  $ echo 30 >  /proc/sys/vm/pagecache_ratio

3/ You can see the effect using:

  $ cat /proc/meminfo
  
  root:/tmp> cat /proc/meminfo
  MemTotal:        54036 kB
  MemFree:         18588 kB
  Buffers:             0 kB
  Cached:          15092 kB
  <snip>
 
  This example is for an IP04 that has been running for a while
  with pagecache_ratio = 30.  Note that the Cached sits at
  about 15M, which is (around) 30% of the MemTotal.
