 NOTES:

 1. Set the /etc/TZ file for your timezone

 2. The TZ env variable in your shell will set the current
    time zone.  This gets set automatically via /etc/profile
    for console and ssh logins, but for some reason it is not
    set in telnet logins (maybe because they currently don't
    have a proper login).

 3. List of magic TZ codes here (thanks Mike Taht):
