1/ From  Karim M (karim786)

I just gave it a try. It works great. Here is what I did to get it working:

1. ipkg update
2. ipkg install ssmtp
3. Added my mail hub to /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf 
4. Added "mailcmd = /sbin/ssmtp -C/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf -t" to the
   general section of voicemail.conf
5. Changed the format to wav from ulaw in the general section of voicemail.conf.

2/ Submitted By: ming c. Li (macli)

You could try ssmtp recipient_email_address < email_content_file to
test if ssmtp works on command line.

/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf:

mailhub=your_mail_host

voicemail.conf:

format=wav49
serveremail=asterisk@legitimate_mail_domain
mailcmd=/bin/ssmtp -t

I use Postfix as my mail host, it will reject email with "sender
domain not found.." if your email address domain part is not FQDN in
voicemail serveremail config
