Wispcar is a small PIC-based device with the following functions:

  1/ Monitor Voltage
  2/ Monitor Current
  3/ Watchdog timer
  4/ Sleep timer

This ipkg contains shell scripts to drive Wispcar on the IP04:

  wispcard: - daemon that sends a 'w' to Wispcar every 3 seconds,
              resetting watchdog and prompting a status line to be
	      sent

  wispcar.: - script executed when status line is sent

Hardware Connection
-------------------

Wispcar is connected to the IP04 RS232 port directly without the RS232
daughter board.  As Wispcar uses 5V logic a resistive voltage divider is
used to drop the tx level from wispcar to the IP04 rx.

U-boot Configuration
--------------------

Wispcar requires a 4800 baud serial connection.  In u-boot, set
bootargs:

  set bootargs ethaddr=your:mac:address root=/dev/mtdblock2 rw console=ttyBF0,4800 

Munin

Use Munin package to monitor Wispcar (current, voltage, watchdog
status) remotely.
