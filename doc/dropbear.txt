1/ To test:

  [host]$ ssh root@your.ip04.ip

  (default root password is uClinux)

2/ Reverse ssh via tunneling trick, useful for maintenance when IP04
is behind a NAT:

  A(IP04) ---> Firewall/NAT -> B(manager)

  From A:

    ssh -R 2048:localhost:22 username@manager

  You need to keep this ssh session running.

  From B:

    ssh root@localhost -p 2048

  We should be able to log into A from B

3/ Lots more information in the README file which is included in the
dropbear source, available from:
