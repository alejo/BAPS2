Munin Node
----------

Munin is a monitoring tool that polls a list of computers and logs the
data.  It presents all the information in graphs through a web
interface.  The data logged is defined by simple to write plugins
stored in /etc/munin/plugins.  There are also hooks to gather SNMP
data.

This package installs a Munin node on a Blackfin system, allowing you
to log and monitor all sorts of data.  It contains several built-in
plugins, please feel to write your own and contribute them to this
package.

This package contains just the Munin node.  You need to run and
configure a Munin master on your (probably) x86 host.  Installation of
the Munin master is covered on the Munim site, and there are several
HOWTOs on the web.  It is very easy to install, e.g. just a few
packages to install under Ubuntu.

Munin Master Conf File
----------------------

Here is a sample /etc/munin/munin.conf for your Munin master that logs
a single IP04:

start munin.conf ------------------------------------------------
# These directories may vary for your Munin Master installation

dbdir   /var/lib/munin
htmldir /var/www/munin/
logdir  /var/log/munin
rundir  /var/run/munin

tmpldir /etc/munin/templates

# This is the important bit - our Blackfin Asterisk box we want
# to monitor

[pbx.yourdomain.com]
    address 192.168.1.28
    use_node_name yes
end munin.conf --------------------------------------------------

Testing Munin Node
------------------

  [host]$ telnet ip04 4949
  Trying 192.168.1.28...
  Connected to ip04.yourdomain.com.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  # munin node at ip04
  list
  load memory
  fetch memory
  memory_used.value 26132
  memory_free.value 32948
  .
  quit
  Connection closed by foreign host.

Fast Update of Munin Master
---------------------------

The Munin master usually polls each node every 5 minutes.  While
developing it's better to get instant feedback.  Here is how I run my
Munin master on demand, and check the results:

root@bunny:/var/log/munin# sudo -u munin /usr/bin/munin-cron
root@bunny:/var/log/munin# tail munin-update.log

Then refresh your web browser.

Further Work
------------

Using asterisk -rx to grab stats is probably a big crude.  Using the
manager interface would be a better method.  Not sure how to do that
through shell script, perhaps pipe a comannd file.
