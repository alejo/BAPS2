[X] Patches to build uClinux-dist for IP04
[X] Build an ipkg for Asterisk
[X] test install ipkg on x86
[X] Build a working ipkg for the IP04
    + three candidates so far:
      + shell script
      + busybox (fork problem)
      + ipkg-cl

Clean Up
--------

[X] Build patches to build uClinux-dist for IP04
[ ] Target to build libgdots
[X] Set up README for basic uImage, e.g. bootargs console=
[ ] Asterisk on the BF537 STAMP
[ ] no need to mention package name twice, e.g.:
      [david@bunny ucasterisk]$ make -f asterisk.mk asterisk
      [david@bunny ucasterisk]$ make -f asterisk.mk asterisk-package
    consider change to:
      [david@bunny ucasterisk]$ make -f asterisk.mk 
      [david@bunny ucasterisk]$ make -f asterisk.mk package
    or maybe even:
      [david@bunny ucasterisk]$ make asterisk
      [david@bunny ucasterisk]$ make asterisk-package
    if we can work out how to recombine makefiles and collect targets
[ ] dropbear, add hooks for installation
    + good test for ipkg
    + work out how to hook inetd stuff
[ ] is there a more sensible dir structure - get others to review?
[X] tutorial on IP04 uClinux-dist hacking
    + modify rc for distro (or motd, or busybox options)
    + how to capture
[X] tutorial/walkthru on simple package (hello)
    + look at steps to compile
    + look at makefile
    + look at what happens on target.
    + compare to more complex example like compiling a uClinux-dist/user program
    + !/bin/sh -x is yr friend for debugging
    + link to msh strangeness

[ ] Hacking tutorial
    + walk people thru development
    [ ] mods to wcfxs
        + rcp wcfxs.ko/insmod etc
    [ ] new zaptel package
        + MD5 problems
        + ipkg update if installing from web
        + remove 'snapshots'file
    [ ] 

[ ] script to automate testing
    + make all packages
    + download to a target and test
    + way to automate uImage install
    + just nominate an IP

[ ] script to automate build and upload
    + build all packages
    + create Package file
    + update on web site
    + ip08.mk is close, maybe rename and include all packages

[X] use symlinks rather than cp for src and config files
    + e.g. consider zaptel/wcfxs.c 
    + we currently cp this from src top zaptel-x.y
    + if we modify zaptel-x.y/wcfxs.c then we must remember to
      cp it ito src to make sure mods get captured by svn
    + better to sym link instead, mods in zaptel/wcfxs-x.y automatically
      captured by SVN version control
    + same for stuff menuselect.makeopts
    + files that don't change much (like small changes to *) we can just use
      patches
